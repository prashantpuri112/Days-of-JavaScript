// Variable name cannot be start with number, it can only contails number letter underscope (_) or dollor sign ($)
// let 5year = 7;
// let Prashant&Puri ='pp', these are the illegal symbol used to declare variable

let Prashant_Puri = 'pp' //correct declaration

// let new = 40;
// let function = 50;
// let name = 90;
// these are the reserved keywords in javascript so we cannot use it directly to declare variable
let $function = 50; //instead we can add symbols to declare


let Person = 'Prashant' //we should not start a variable name with the upper case letter as it is used for specific usecase in JS for OOP
let PI = 3.14; // as the value of pie is constant so I have used Uppercase in all letter

// Suggested approch to implement as it is descriptive
let myFirstName = 'Prashant';
let myFamilyName = 'Puri';

// Not to implement like this cause it is not descriptive
let name = 'prashant';
let cast = 'puri';

console.log(myFirstName);
